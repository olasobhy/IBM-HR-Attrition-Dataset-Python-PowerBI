# IBM-HR-Dataset-Python-PowerBI
<br>
**Overview**
<br>
This repository contains an analysis of the IBM HR Attrition Dataset using Python and Power BI. The project demonstrates how to explore, analyze, and visualize HR data to gain insights into employee attrition and includes predictive modeling to forecast attrition risk.

Contents
<br>
IBM-HR-Attrition-Dataset.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with Python code for data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and predictions.
PowerBI_Report.pbix: Power BI file with interactive visualizations and dashboards based on the IBM HR dataset.
<br>
Usage
<br>
Python Notebook
<br>
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.
<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and trends related to employee attrition.
<br>
Handling Imbalanced Classes: Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance and improve model performance.
<br>
Predictive Modeling:
<br>
Models Used: I used RandomForestClassifier to predict attrition risk.
<br>
Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
<br>
Visualization: Visualize the results and predictions to gain actionable insights.
<br>
Power BI Report
<br>
Explore interactive dashboards and reports to visualize HR metrics and attrition trends.
Use the insights from the predictive models to inform decision-making and strategic planning.
